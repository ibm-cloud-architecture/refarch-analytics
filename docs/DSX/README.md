# Data Science eXperience
This article presents how to get started on DSX running on ICP 2.1. This is an education material build from our own skill ramp-up.
The server used is https://169.46.44.164:31843/
You can register or use one of e CASE userid as a set up a LDAP server connected to DSX.

# Learn with Basic notebooks
## Spark and notebook
This should be your first notebook to test. The project is named  > dsx-samples > Learn+basics+about+notebooks+and+Apache+Spark+Local.ipynb. It uses PySpark to integrate Spark within python code with weather Dataset.

The tutorial is light on context and expect python, spark previous knowledge. 

There are some change to the tutorial content as the DSX product user interface evolved.
* Launching the notebooks
* Get weather data
* Upload to the Object storage using the menu
* The first thing a Spark program must do is to create a SparkContext object, which tells Spark how to access a cluster.
